# ComfyUI-MagicWan
Implementing FlowEdit, maybe other inversion techniques for the Wan video generation model

Borrows very heavily from [HunyuanLoom](https://github.com/logtd/ComfyUI-HunyuanLoom) which implements [FlowEdit](https://github.com/fallenshock/FlowEdit). 

WIP, very experimental, and probably bugged in various ways.
